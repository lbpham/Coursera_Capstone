    "## A. Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Vietnam has been experiencing rapid retail growth of +10% between 2013-2020. As the country with the fastest-growing middle class in Southeast Asia, this phenomenal growth rates in its retail sector is expected to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/KyMNM6X/Retail-VN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, although Vietnam's retail sector holds immense potential for growth, the level of competition is intense. With different store formats: commercial centres, supermarkets, grocery stores and convenience stores, domestic and foreign retail giants in Vietnam are engaging in a battle for dominance as they embark on aggressive expansion strategies. At the same time, despite the rise of digital channels, physical channels continue to dominate the retail scene. Therefore, an interesting questions to ask is how if the retail footprint of these retail giants in Vietnam, and which province/city/district should be the next target for new stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, this project is aimed to understand and present:\n",
    "* The retail footprint of retal giants (both domestic and foreign companies) in Vietnam\n",
    "* Clustering the province/districts based on the retail footprint (number of stores available) and census statistic (population, area, GDP/capita, economic growth, etc.)\n",
    "* Understand the different clusters of province/district to recommend the next city/province/district for stores expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Data and analytical approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analysis, the following data was obtained to perform the analysis:\n",
    "* **List of Vietnam's Administrative Division:** at Provincial and District level. This information is obtained from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam database (retrieved at April 04, 2020, at [GSO database](https://www.gso.gov.vn/dmhc2015/))\n",
    "* **Census data:** includes each province's data on population, area, population density, Human Development Index, GDP/capital (retrieved at April 04, 2020, from [Wikipedia](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E1%BB%89nh_th%C3%A0nh_Vi%E1%BB%87t_Nam#cite_note-5))\n",
    "* **Stores list of major retail chains:** based on [Deloitte report on Vietnam Retail 2019](https://www2.deloitte.com/vn/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/vietnam-consumer-retail-2019.html), the following retail chains are identified and their store list are obtained from their main websites by web scrapping. The result of webscrapping is the store list with (1) store name, (2) store adress, and (3) latitude and longitude of the store.\n",

    "### 2. Analytical approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, K-Means Clustering method will be use to profilling province/district base on the retail footprint and statistical census. From [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms-part-9-k-means-example-in-python-f2ad05ed5203), K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, attempting to classify data without having first been trained with labeled data. Since the purpose of this project is to understand the retail footprint acrross different Administrative Division in Vietnam, this method is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the optimum number of clusters in this analysis, we will evaluate the relationship between the number of clusters and Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to select the number of clusters where the change in WCSS begins to level off (elbow method).
